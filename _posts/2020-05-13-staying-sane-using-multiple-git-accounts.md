The other day, I wanted to work with many git accounts on my laptop and I felt it was not easy and required many steps. I had to understand how things worked when you use git via ssh and the role of ssh-agent. Also, I had to refer to many articles and connect dots from them to be able to make it work for me. I felt I should document these steps so it can help other folks to use this and save time and the possible pain points they might be facing :)



If you don't have the need to use many git accounts - I'm sure there will be learnings for you on how things actually work. So stay with me and keep reading  


In case you have an existing git setup and looking to to start fresh, head to [Troubleshoot section](#Troubleshooting)



### Setting Up

#### Generate SSH keys


Check your current SSH keys (back if you need them before deleting or leave them). They are all located at `~/.ssh/`. View them using `ls -al ~/.ssh/`

Generate new SSH keys using below commands

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "vg@work.com" -f "id_work_user"
```

Set the passphrase, so the keys are secure even if you lose the device. Also let's use RSA and avoid using DSA based algorithms (blog post coming soon on that). There are 2 files generated `id_work_user` and `id_work_user.pub` at the location `~/.ssh`.

Let's dissect the above command. 

`-t` option to specify the encryption algorithm, default is DSA. I will write more about how DSA can be brute forced even with password enabled ssh keys

`-C` comment that will help us associate the key with its purpose, we will see the command later

`-f` file name can be used for saving

Run the above command for the other git accounts too

```shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "vinayakg@personal.com" -f "id_my_user"
```

All the generated keys will be at `~/.ssh` and we have 2 private keys (no extn) and 2 public keys (`.pub`)

#### Let your provider know these keys 

This will help us setup the auth when we push or pull code via git. We will use [GitHub](https://gitHub.com) for this example

Copy your public key `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_work_user.pub` and then log in to your personal GitHub account:

1. Go to `Settings`
2. Select `SSH and GPG keys` from the menu to the left.
3. Click on `New SSH key`, provide a suitable title, and paste the key in the box below
4. Click `Add key` — and you’re done!

Repeat the above steps for the other keys generated for other accounts in the above step



#### Setting up and usage



##### The SSH-Agent way


To use the above keys for auth we need to register with the `ssh-agent` on our machine. Ensure `ssh-agent` is running on the machine by using this command

```shell
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Now add these agents using the below command

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work_user1
```

###### Usage

To start using ssh-agent, you need to set useremail registered with git. git uses this for authentication, username (does not matter - could be any, please do try and see

Commands:

```bash
git config -l                                    #list the current config
git config --global user.name 'vinayakg'         #set the git username in config globally
git config --global user.email 'vg@work.com'     #set the git useremail in config globally 
```

With the config set , we need to set the ssh-agent - it only accepts one active key at a time

```bash
ssh-add -D && ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_work_user
```

The above command will delete all existing set keys ssh-agent for ssh-agent and will set the one we want

And you can do a git clone on a new repository and work with it by using our familiar commands

```shell
git clone git@github.com:vinayakg/repo
```

The next time you have to work on many git accounts follow the above steps (`git config` && `ssh-add`). It's also possible to create handy aliases in git or in shell to save the number of keystrokes. You need not use the global command with git config if you are working on an existing repository. It's also possible to set email in the local .git/config, but this is not helpful for new repositories

##### The SSH Config way	( The Preferred way)

Here we are going to use the same ssh config that we use for SSH auth while connecting to other machines over cloud. This method needs only changing the url while `git clone` and setting the url while adding `git remote` . Also this does not rely on any folder structures or other commands .

The SSH config is at `~/.ssh/config`. If this file does not exist for you, please go ahead and create it.

```shell
touch ~/.ssh/config 
```

Now open the editor and add the below config

```bash
# Personal account
Host gh                               # used for identifying amongst other accounts
   HostName github.com                # git provider website
   User git                           # default user, no need to change
  #AddKeysToAgent yes                 # we are using many, so we will ignore this 
  UseKeychain yes                     # save to keychain
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_work_user   # private key
   
# Work account-1
Host gh-work    
   HostName github.com
   User git
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work_user
```

 We will see below how to use these ==Host== name that we setup

######  Usage

Now we have 2 accounts configured. Let's say you want to clone code from the personal account. Use the below command. This command will set correct git remotes. So we don't have to worry when we switch back after working in another account

```shell
git clone git@gh:vinayakg/repo
```



For second, we can use the similar command

```shell
git clone git@gh-work:work/repo
```



### Troubleshooting

#### Issues with existing git accounts on your machine

The default git account on the machine seems to take precedence and wont let us use the other git account. To set things fresh, let's clear using the  below command. git config won't be of so much help

Follow the below steps to reset your existing/previous settings

###### Step 1

```shell
$ git credential-osxkeychain erase
host=github.com
protocol=https
<press return>
<press return>
```



###### Step 2

Follow this step if step1 did not work

Go to Launcher :arrow_right: search box :arrow_right:type git username :arrow_right: then press delete :x:

###### Step 3

Now check your ssh-add listing and see the certifications that are currently configured. If you see any suspects go ahead and delete them

`ssh-add -l` lists the attached credentials

`ssh-add -D` delete all the attached ones

And if you have many or `user.email` or `user.name` then go ahead and clear them with the following commands

```bash
git config --unset user.email && git config --unset user.name
```



#### Permission denied (publickey)

Try to debug and see why the auth is failing using the below command. user is always `git` (for more details see [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/error-permission-denied-publickey#always-use-the-git-user)) and `gh` is the alias that we have set (`gh` translates to `github.com`) 

```shell
ssh -vT git@gh
```

Check if you have the right key on [GitHub](github.com) by using the below command

```shell
ssh-add -l -E md5
```



#### Change remotes for existing git repositories

If you have existing repository, you can change the remotes using the below command

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@gh-work:work/repo
```



### More Tips

You can also use `git config` with includeIf to set `git config` for work and personal account, thats a preference; I will leave that for now

```shell
[includeIf "gitdir:~/work/"]
		path = ~/work/.gitconfig
```

And the corresponding config too

```
[user]
    email = john.doe@company.tld
```



### Learnings & Conclusion

It was real fun learning and experimenting all this with multiple accounts all by myself. I also understood the major role of ssh-agent works and how you don't need the agent for git auth if you use the ssh config
