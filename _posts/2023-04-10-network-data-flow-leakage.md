## Background

I have been using pihole VPN for the last year or more and have been happy with the ad-free and faster browsing experience. 

However, I wondering how the entire network stack works in the context of security and privacy. I had questions like - How the domain requests get sent from the device to the router and then how router takes it forward/sends to ISP? Who can read that data? How the response is sent back, can someone tamper that response? Which is the safest technology to use for DNS so you dont have to worry about any tampering/snooping/mitm and send wrong response and trick us into a scam?



I will try and breakdown and answer all these questions below. Also I will be discussing DoH(application layer) only and not DoT(transport layer) as DoH work over port 443 which is default open unlike 853 used by DoT which could be blocked.



## How our networks resolve domain names (DNS) üåê

In any network (home/office) you take an internet connection from an ISP and you hook that to a router. All ISP's provide their own default DNS settings for all network connections. Please see sample below.

For any DNS (Domain name resolution), port 53 is used and the DNS query is sent in plain text to the Name Servers of ISP- making it easy for your provider to read.

There are ways to make this secure using DoH(DNS over HTTPS) and DoT(DNS over TLS) end to end, we will see that later below

## How is DoH(DNS over HTTPS) protecting privacy üîí


Let us try and understand how DoH is secure and how it protects the privacy.

DNS over HTTPS (DoH) is a protocol for performing DNS resolution via the HTTPS protocol, which is the same protocol used to access websites securely. DoH is designed to improve privacy and security by encrypting DNS traffic, preventing eavesdropping, and thwarting man-in-the-middle attacks.

Traditionally, DNS requests are sent in plain text, which means that anyone who can intercept the traffic can see what domain names are being accessed. This can be a significant privacy risk, as it allows ISPs and other third parties to track a user's online activities and build a profile of their browsing habits.

DoH encrypts DNS traffic between the user's device(router/phone) and the DNS resolver, making it much more difficult for third parties to intercept or eavesdrop on the traffic. 

Also - though the request is encrypted using DoH, the ISP can still the DNS resolver, but ISP cannot see the contents of the encrypted DNS network, so ISP cannot know which specific domain was requested.



Example

`curl https://dns.google.com/resolve\?name\=example.com\&type\=A HTTP/1.1| jq`

## How DNSSEC does it?

DNSSEC is a set of extensions to the DNS protocol that adds cryptographic security to DNS queries and responses. It uses digital signatures to ensure the authenticity and integrity of DNS data, allowing clients to verify that the information they receive from a DNS resolver is legitimate and has not been tampered with.

In a DNSSEC-secured environment, every zone in the DNS hierarchy is signed with a private key. This key is used to generate digital signatures for every DNS record in the zone, creating a chain of trust that can be verified by clients.

When a DNSSEC client sends a query for a domain name, it receives a digitally-signed response that includes a chain of digital signatures from the root zone to the queried zone. The client can then verify the authenticity of the response by validating the digital signatures and checking that the chain of trust is complete and unbroken.



DNSSEC provides several benefits over DoH, including:

1. Enhanced authenticity and integrity: DNSSEC provides strong cryptographic assurances that the DNS data has not been tampered with or modified in transit.
2. Prevents DNS spoofing: DNSSEC helps prevent DNS cache poisoning and other attacks by ensuring that clients only receive legitimate responses from DNS resolvers.
3. More granular control: DNSSEC allows for more granular control over access to DNS data, enabling zone owners to specify which clients are authorized to access their DNS data.



While DNSSEC is a powerful tool for securing the DNS, it does have some limitations. One of the biggest challenges of DNSSEC is that it requires significant administrative effort to set up and maintain. Additionally, DNSSEC can create significant overhead in terms of the size of DNS responses, which can impact network performance.

Example

`dig +dnssec example.com A @1.1.1.1`



In summary, while DNSSEC and DoH both address different aspects of DNS security, DNSSEC is generally considered to provide stronger cryptographic assurance of DNS data authenticity and integrity. However, DoH can provide privacy and security benefits that are complementary to DNSSEC.



## What does the ISP see when using VPN? üëÄ 



When you use a VPN tunnel, your traffic is encrypted before it leaves your device and travels through the VPN server, making it much more difficult for anyone to intercept or read your data. Essentially, a VPN creates a secure, private tunnel between your device and the VPN server, which acts as a middleman between you and the internet.

Your ISP can still see that you are connected to a VPN, but they won't be able to see the details of your internet traffic, as it is encrypted. They will be able to see the IP address of the VPN server that you are connecting to, but they won't be able to see the websites you visit or the data you transmit.

It's important to note that not all VPNs are created equal, and some may leak your IP address or fail to properly encrypt your traffic, so it's important to choose a reputable VPN provider and ensure that your VPN connection is properly configured and secured.

However, it's worth noting that while a VPN can provide privacy and security for your internet traffic, it does not provide complete anonymity. Your online activity may still be tracked by the websites you visit or other third-party services, and your VPN provider may also log your activity. It's also possible for government agencies or law enforcement to request information from your VPN provider.

In summary, a VPN can provide an extra layer of security and privacy for your internet traffic, but it's important to choose a reputable provider and understand the limitations of VPN technology.

## How can one use DoH üíª

Internet is needed by all services that are running on the device. It could be a browser that we use and interact with for web activity. Or it could be an app or service that we might be using for various tasks as part of our device usage.

There are 2 way to use DoH. One solution is browser based solution and works on Windows/Mac and Linux - here the network requests made by apps or services are not covered.

The other solution is a system wide solution that ensures all DNS requests are covered - which is a prefered solution



### Browser only solution

Please find below steps for all systems

| Windows                                                      | MacOS                                                        | Android                                                      |

## Preferred DoH setup üëç

I have a pihole with pivpn, so when I connect using vpn - it blocks websites. No seperate DoH is needed. If you would like to read about how to setup, please use [this link](https://vinayakg.dev/invest-in-your-digital-security-with-pihole-wiregaurd-vpn).

There are also cases some apps wont work detecting a vpn connection (e.g. Prime Video, Netflix, irctc, Myntra, et al). In such cases since VPN can't be used, no ads/malicious websites are blocked.

In order to leverage the same pihole blocking without using pivpn, I prefer to setup my own DoH and use it on all devices.

You may read about it in my next blog. Till then stay tuned.
