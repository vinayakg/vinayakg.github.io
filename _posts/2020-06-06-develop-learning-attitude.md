This is one of the talks I gave to [Newton School folks](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/newtonschool_learner-webinar-livewebinar-activity-6674543368774782976-hT9U)

#### Gist of the talk

"Instruction ends in the classroom but education is for forever". With growing knowledge base, ease of distribution and changing priorities and activities in our life how do we stay focused and continue to educate ourselves. In this talk we will go through various aspects of learning and will also talk about techniques and tips on how we can develop a learning attitude and continue learning.
